<p>The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league’s Western Conference Pacific Division.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warriors dynasty</strong><br>The Warriors completed the 2014–2015 regular season with a league-best record of 67–15, setting a Warriors record for wins.[67] The team finished with a home record of 39–2, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team’s opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2–1 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors’ small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[68] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.</p>
<p>The Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017–18 regular season record of 58–24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4–1, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3–2 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors staved off elimination and came back to win the series 4–3, winning the Western Conference for the 4th straight year. The 2018 Finals pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season; this marked the first time in NBA history that the same two teams had met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship</p>

<p>Nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of “W’s”, the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.Only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more NBA championships. The Warriors are the third most valuable NBA franchise and the fifth-highest valued sports franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $4.3 billion.<br>Surprisingly, the</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors’ market value has skyrocketed in recent years, a trend that began with the arrival of star player Stephen Curry in 2009. And there was a staged increase after the championship</p>
