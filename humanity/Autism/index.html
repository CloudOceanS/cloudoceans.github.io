            <p>Different society’s view on mental disabilities (Autism or Savant-Syndrome)</p>
<p>In today’s society, the story about autism has not been paid attention by people, until the recent American TV series “The Good Doctor”, which gradually reveals the world of autistic people to the public. The Good Doctor tells the story of a gifted autistic doctor who uses his talents to help patients and who has trouble communicating with patients and colleagues. So, we’re going to discuss in this paper whether or not people with autism are well suited to having a job or getting fair treatment in society, especially with Savant-Syndrome.</p>
<p>Savant syndrome, rare condition wherein a person of less than normal intelligence or severely limited emotional range has prodigious intellectual gifts in a specific area. Mathematical, musical, artistic, and mechanical abilities have been among the talents demonstrated by savants.<br>These disorders are characterized by problems with communication and social interaction. People with ASD often demonstrate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped interests or patterns of behavior. However, Savant-Syndrome is an entirely different case, and its social manifestations can be more controversial than autism.So some people with ASDs are classified as high-functioning. High-functioning autism (Savant-Syndrome) means that these individuals don’t have delayed language skills and cognitive development that is typical of many people with ASDs. Often, individuals diagnosed with AS have above normal intelligence. Therefore, they may have natural advantages in particular areas of scientific research like Mathematics or Computer science. Moreover, they also have a better capacity for everyday life.At this time, however, two completely different views emerged in society. The first view is that although autistic people or people who have Savant-Syndrome cannot communicate well with normal people, they will show understanding and show that some Savant-Syndrome patient may perform better at their work than themselves.</p>
<p>Society’s view, or outsiders’ view of autism, is for the most part demeaning and condescending. People with autism are treated as subhuman simply because they have difficulty communicating. When dealing with people with autism, “typical neurotics” tend, for the most part, to view them as “stupid” or “not smart” because they are unable to express their feelings or hold a normal conversation. However, a minority of society (unfortunately) belongs to those who accept the “new paradigm”. They’ve made a valiant effort to really understand what it’s like to live with someone with autism and how their brain works. They are not intrinsically demeaning or labeling anyone as “disabled.” “The idea that people with autism don’t want to communicate, would rather be isolated and don’t want company is simply wrong.”</p>
<p>For those who think that autism is not suitable to survive in this society, their first and very convincing reason is that people with autism can not successfully find a suitable job. Most jobs require a group of people to work together, such as a company that specializes in writing programs, and they need different people to work on different sections. “Some days it is really hard to function … things like fluorescent lighting can even bring my systems down,” a woman who have Asperger’s said, meaning the lighting will depresses her mood easily. She also said, “Even the thought of interviewing for a job can be overwhelming for someone on the autism spectrum. That is such an intimate setting. That alone can keep people from finding a job.” Obviously, both of the statements from the woman represents that people with autism cannot effectively communicate with normal people. Hiring such people is devastating for a company. Other employees need to spend unnecessary time with the autistic person, and the time that would have been used to complete the work is now spent communicating with the autistic person. The most immediate consequence is a decline in productivity, which means that the quality of work and the company’s profits are also affected. However, these people have this idea based on the fact that the vast majority of people with autism, up to 90 percent, have strong symptoms. At this time, another view also appeared from the society. They found that the so-called autistic patients were not 100% unable to communicate with normal people. There are many autistic people may just be not suitable for making friends with others, but they can correctly complete the tasks assigned by their leaders. The information is from a BBC interview with autistic people, which briefly explains the situation of finding a job for autistic people. So it can be saying this perspective is both come from individual and organization.</p>
<p>Oppositely, the other side of the argument is totally different. They believe that autism, especially Asperger’s, can give full play to its advantages in certain fields, and it is necessary to give people with autism an equal social status, including various social benefits such as Healthcare.<br>Jobs for People with Autism or Aspergers Syndrome:<br>Here is a list of some of the good jobs for people with Aspergers which are differentiated into three sections based on the skills they possess.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jobs for Visual Thinkers </li>
<li>Jobs for Non-Visual Thinkers: For ones who are good at math, music or facts </li>
<li>Jobs for Nonverbal People with Autism or People with Poor Verbal Skills</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the diagram, most of the work is related to brainpower and doing. People with autism do not have strong social skills, but their IQ is sometimes higher than the average person, so these jobs which require strong calculation and memory ability are very suitable for them.In theory, those who pay taxes are entitled to social resources provided by the government. Since people with autism can find a job, they naturally have the same social status as ordinary people, even if their social skills are not very good. These views are come from website, so it more likely represent individual’s idea.</p>
<p>From my points of view, both views are reasonable, but I personally prefer the second view, which is that people with autism should have the same social status as normal people, and I also agree that people with Savant-Syndrome can be qualified for certain positions. On the basis of the second point, I would like to add that we ordinary people should give more time and opportunities to people with autism. In fact, when I first saw the first objection, 90 percent of me was convinced. Because the examples from the first point of view are pretty straightforward. From the perspective of work efficiency and colleague relationship, it tells the story of the decline in productivity due to the inability to deal with interpersonal relationship. But my final opinion was confirmed when I saw that these people with autism can show that they have superior IQs and are capable of some very difficult tasks.In terms of what evidence I have to support my view, “The Autism Society of America advocates for federal public policies that improve the lives of children and adults with autism. These policies include early intervention, k-12 education, postsecondary education, transition services, employment, health care, and home and community-based services and supports.” I quote from the national website of autism. I think this can be the proof of my view, the country’s thinking and my thinking are mostly overlaps. I hope that in 2021, the problem of autism can be better solved, of course, it would be great if more effective drugs could be developed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this paper mainly discusses the social status of autistic patients in recent years and whether they are suitable for getting a good job. The two most popular arguments are that autistic people are less likely to get a job because of their poor design skills, because companies or teams with autistic people spend more time communicating from a productivity standpoint. On the other side of the spectrum is the idea that autism can do a job, and that people with Savant-Syndrome, in particular, are far more competent in certain areas. Even if they don’t have strong social skills, they don’t have much impact on programmers or data analysts. Moreover, according to the baidu’s database. Derek Paravicini, blind, gave his first concert at the age of nine. Christopher Taylor, can speak, read and write 17 languages. Stephen Wiltshire, with just one observation, can draw objects very accurately. Leslie Lemke, once she heard a piece of music, she could copy it. These are all good examples.</p>
